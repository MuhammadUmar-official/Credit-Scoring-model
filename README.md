## Credit Scoring Machine Learning model:
The Credit Scoring Model predicts customer creditworthiness using the German Credit dataset. The project includes:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Handling missing values & outliers

Label encoding / feature scaling

Model training & threshold tuning

Model evaluation (Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC)

The goal of this project is to build a reliable and interpretable credit risk classification model that helps analyze which customers are likely to default on loans.
